Coding challenge: create another model.
To reinforce the process of managing models, controller and views, create another model class in addition to the Products Model. This will go in the Models folder. Create a controller and View to display the new item in a table.

1. Create a class for another object which represents a product (Movie, Car, Airline Ticket, etc).
2. Create another Controller and View.
3. Generate some sample data for the new item.
4. Display the resulting list in a table.
5. Take a screenshot of the app at this stage. Pate it into a Word document and caption the image with a brief explanation of what you just demonstrated.
